### MySQL Server setup
1. Login into your sql server through sql client, you can use `mysql -u root -p -h localhost` to login the database. The default password should be 'admin'
2. Then change the password of `root` role for your Mysql server. This can be done by running `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';` in the command line / terminal.
3. Create a database name called `5709Project`

It would be more straightforward if your have mysql workbench application in your machine, then you can import the database by following the procedures described in this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-management.html).
